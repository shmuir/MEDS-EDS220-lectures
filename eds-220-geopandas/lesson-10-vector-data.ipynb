    "## Points, Lines, and Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Points**: each point has a single x,y location. Examples of pointdata that can be represented as point vector data are sampling locations or animal sightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lines**: a line is composed of at least two points that are connected. Roads and streams are commonly depicted as line vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polygons**: polygons are sets of three or more vertices that are connected and form a closed region. Political boundaries (outlines of countires, states, cities, etc) are examples of polygon vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **.shp**: shape format, this file has the geometries for all features.\n",
    "- **.shx**: shape index format, this file indexes the features\n",
    "- **.dbf**: attribute format, this file stores the attributes for features as a table\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes shapefiles will have additional files, including:\n",
    "- **.prj**: a file containing information about the projection and coordinate reference system\n",
    "- **.sbn** and **.sbx**: files that contian a spatial index of the features\n",
    "- **.shp.xml**: geospatial metadata in XML format."
